and the gifs and icons into that directory, and run nsis on it.

cd dist
copy ..\bittorrent.nsi .
copy ..\*.gif .
copy ..\icon*.ico .
c:\progra~1\nsis\makensis.exe bittorrent.nsi

This will create an installer called bittornado-x.x.x.w32install.exe

The installer is completely self-contained and will work on any 
Windows machine, even without the above software having been 
installed.
